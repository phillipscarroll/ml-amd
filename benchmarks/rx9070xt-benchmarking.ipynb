    "If you purchase this card I would not strip it down and replace the thermal interfaces. The OEM pads are very soft and clay like, this allows for deep seating of the die and full pad contact with components. The die interface is a phase change of some sort, most likely PTM 7950 which is already a top tier tim. I did drop a couple dregrees on all components its not worth the warranty removal. This card in particular hides a screw under the serial number sticker and also has an offset, hard to remove screw keeping the cooler connected to the backplate. \n",

    "Because we are so new in the lifecycle of the RNDA4 product line there is no ROCm support. For now we will just be testing LLM performance against the card using Vulkan and so far its very good."
